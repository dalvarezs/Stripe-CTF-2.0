Welcome to the penultimate level, Level 7.

WaffleCopter is a new service delivering locally-sourced organic waffles hot off of vintage waffle irons straight to your location using quad-rotor GPS-enabled helicopters. The service is modeled after TacoCopter, an innovative and highly successful early contender in the airborne food delivery industry. WaffleCopter is currently being tested in private beta in select locations.

Your goal is to order one of the decadent Li√®ge Waffles, offered only to WaffleCopter's first premium subscribers.
